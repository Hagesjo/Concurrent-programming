\section{Introduction}
This part will introduce the reader to the report.
At the beginning, describe what the purpose of this lab report is. Then
describe briefly what each section discusses and finally summarize the most
important conclusions.

\section{Method}
\subsection{Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)}
Describe what you did in lab 2 and what you have learnt. In addition,
discuss your findings and observations during this lab. Summarize your an-
swers to the questions in the lab PM and present the block diagrams that
you have drawn. Furthermore, describe how your ALU performs subtrac-
tion using an adder. Remember to always explain your design choices and
mention any assumptions. Finally, make use of figures and tables.
\subsection{Top-level Design}
Describe what you did in lab 3. In addition, describe how you implemented
the bus using the mux and any extra logic or the tri-state buffers. Describe
briefly how you implemented the storage elements that are used by the
ChAcc processor. Show one snapshot of the simulation waveform where you
write something to a memory location and then read from it. Remember to
always explain your design choices and mention any assumptions. Finally,
make use of figures and tables.
\subsection{Controller}
Describe what you did in lab4. More specifically, show the Finite-state ma-
chine (FSM) of the controller by presenting the diagram you drew. Which
design decisions did you make and why? Also include few waveforms, where
you show that the controller runs correctly for some particular instructions
using the provided testbench. Remember to always explain your design
choices and mention any assumptions. Finally, make use of figures and ta-
bles.
\subsection{Processor's Testbench}
Describe what you did in lab5. More specifically, describe how you made
the testbench to verify that your processor design was functionally correct.
For example, you can specify how you generated inputs to the processor
during the testing, how you were reading the expected outputs and how
you compare the expected outputs with the actual outputs. Also mention if
your processor design was working correctly from the beginning and if not
describe how you backtrack the bugs. Remember to always explain your
design choices and mention any assumptions. Finally, make use of figures
and tables.
